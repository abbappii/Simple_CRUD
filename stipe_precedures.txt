    - need to add stripe public key and secret key
    - create PaymentIntent with
        - amount,currency,payment_method_types, etc

    - if we want everything from the backend we can create a button for product and link via webhook to call this order api
      it will proceed with stripe payment.
    - or we can implement stripe payment payload pass in the fronted with total amount and others.
